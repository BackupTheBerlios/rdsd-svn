rdsd \- Radio Data System daemon

This is a preliminary man page for the pre\-Alpha
development version of rdsd. Not everything described
in here necessarily works yet! Parameters might change
before rdsd becomes stable.
.SH "SYNTAX"
.LP 
rdsd [\fIoptions\fP]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 
rdsd is a program to read and decode Radio Data System (RDS)
data from one or more input sources. Clients can connect to
rdsd via TCP/IP or a unix domain socket.
.LP 
rdsd can run as a normal console program or as a daemon, the 
latter being the standard mode of operation. Only one instance
of rdsd can run at a time.
.LP 
rdsd reads its configuration from a configuration file, default
is /etc/rdsd.conf. Only a few options can be given on the command
line.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.LP 
.TP 
\fB\-c\fR <\fIfilename\fP>
Read configuration from <\fIfilename\fP> instead
of the default /etc/rdsd.conf
.TP 
\fB\-d\fR
Run as a daemon in the background. If you don't give this
option, rdsd won't fork.
.TP 
\fB\-h\fR
Output help information and exit.
.TP 
\fB\-k\fR
Kill a running rdsd by sending it a SIGINT.
.TP 
\fB\-r\fR
Ask a running rdsd to reload its configuration by sending
it a SIGHUP.
.TP 
\fB\-v\fR
Output version information and exit.
.SH "CONFIGURATION FILE"
.LP 
A configuration file for rdsd consists of
sections containing name=value pairs.

The file normally has a [global] section and
one or more [source] sections.

An example file showing all options looks
like this:

.IP 
.nf 
[global]
unix\-socket = "/var/tmp/rdsd.sock"
tcpip\-port = 4321
logfile = "/var/tmp/rdsd.log"
pidfile = "/var/tmp/rdsd.pid"
console\-log = yes
file\-log = yes
loglevel = 5

[source]
name = "Terratec PCI card"
path = "/dev/radio0"
type = "radiodev"

[source].br 
name = "Test data file"
.br 
path = "/home/hans/develop/testdata.rds"
type = "file"
 
[source]
name = "SAA6588 via i2c"
path = "/dev/i2c\-0"
type = "i2cdev"
.fi 

.LP 
Parameters in [global] section:

.TP 
\fBunix\-socket\fR
The unix domain socket where rdsd should accept connections.
.TP 
\fBtcpip\-port\fR
The TCP/IP port rdsd listens on.
.TP 
\fBlogfile\fR
Name of a logfile to use.
.TP 
\fBpidfile\fR
Name of a file where rdsd stores its pid.
.TP 
\fBconsole\-log\fR
Boolean value, if set to yes (or 1), rdsd will output log
messages on the console as long as this is possible (before
entering daemon mode).
.TP 
\fBfile\-log\fR
Boolean value, if set to yes (or 1), rdsd will output log messages
to the file named above.
.TP 
\fBloglevel\fR
Integer value (0..5), the higher the value, the more information
is given. When loglevel is 0, only emergency situations are reported.

.LP 
Parameters in [source] section:

.TP 
\fBname\fR
Name of the source. This will be name reported by the esrc (enum sources)
command. It should be a descriptive string that can be presented to a
user. If it contains blanks, it should be enclosed by double quotes.

.TP 
\fBpath\fR
A valid path. The kind of file (regular or device) expected depends on
the type parameter.

.TP 
\fBtype\fR
One of radiodev | i2cdev | file. "file" and "i2cdev" are mainly for
development and debugging purposes.
.SH "PROTOCOL"
.LP 
Normally there is no need to deal with the protocol
that rdsd uses for its socket connections. The user
library librds handles that for you.

(TODO: Add brief protocol description here...)
.SH "FILES"
.LP 
\fI/etc/rdsd.conf\fP 
.br 
\fI/var/run/rdsd.pid\fP 
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.LP 
To run rdsd as a daemon, you will usually setup /etc/rdsd.conf,
and then simply start the program with
.LP 
rdsd \-d
.LP 
You can stop a running rdsd with the following command: 
.LP 
rdsd \-k
.LP 
For debugging purposes it is sometimes helpfull if rdsd doesn't
put itself in the background. You can achieve this by omitting
the \-d option. This allows you to see debug messages in your 
console window. For experiments, you might also want to
use a configuration file in your home directory instead of 
/etc/rdsd.conf. The following command does all this:
.LP 
rdsd \-c /home/hans/mytest.conf
